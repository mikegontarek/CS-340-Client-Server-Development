MongoDB Dash and Python application.

***How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

*When writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable I try to write good clean code with good comments.  This allows anyone after me to come in and be able to see what I was thinking and allow them to add to my code. When creating my CRUD code, I made sure to comment what each function was doing. In the future I could use this code when I am looking to create a CRUD function as a base to start from.  

***How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

*When looking at a problem that needs to be solved, I tend to try and break the problem into smaller steps. By using logic and breaking problems into smaller sections I can get good starts on a solution and adjust as I continue the project. I have learned how to break down problems and plan or write out what I am trying to do before writing code.  I will look to use CRUD in every database that I may need to use in the future. From CRUD I can make any adjustments needed. 

***What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

*Computer scientists as it relates to the degree I am going for and the projects I'm working on make applications to solve a userâ€™s problems.  This class we had a client that needed to be able to search for dogs based off certain characteristics to help them pick the best dog for the job.
